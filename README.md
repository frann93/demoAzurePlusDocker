Demo project

## Welcome to my Azure Function Plus Docker Project everybody

There are 2 folder as you may see. The folder number 0 contains the project i developed, a Timer Trigger that connects to a local database created
with SQL Server and make changes on the column status from 1 to 0 when it past 5 days of a potencially buy order, based on the date of it and check it every 5 seconds! (fot this example :D).

In the folder with number 1 you may see a Default Timer Trigger created with Docker!

Note: To run the project number 0 (My Timer Trigger) you need to set the enviroment of the database (i let you the script .sql to do so) and set
the connection string properly.

I really really	had enjoyed presenting this demo for you, it was a nice challenge and i did my best with many problems with my S.O actually.

Enjoy it,
Cya
